Greetings Exile! 

This is an excellent column to record any notes you may have regarding your build. Item choices, currency making strategies, nice places to see around Wraeclast, anything you see fit really. Hit the "Edit" button to make changes and don't forget to save!

This middle column can be used to view any other website within this website. One great use is to be able to see your skill tree while leveling in addition to the other info you've stored. I've put you straight at PoE Planner, simply import your build or plan it right here to get started. Once you have your tree outlined, arrow over to Import/Export and copy the Share Link. Once you have your URL use the dropdown at the top of the column to select "Create New" and then hit the "Edit" button, name it whatever you like and paste your URL in and hit "Save" you can now select it from the drop down and hit "Load" to pull it up. You can do this with any site you want to see, PoE Ninja works great if you want to keep an eye on an item or have currency conversion rates available at a glance, or maybe you want to takeover the scarab market and monitor your currency making kingdom from Wealthy Exile. As with Path of Exile, your imagination will unlock the true power of this tool. 

The third column is for storing images that you may want to see at a glance. Having various cheatsheets ready to go for all of the different league mechanics is a no brainer. Perhaps you want a simple diagram outlining your gem swaps so you can finally beat Ben for that top spot on the ladder, or maybe just a picture of your pet Rhoa to keep you motivated. If you want to see any image fullscreen, just click the expand arrows that appear when you hover on the image. If an image is no longer needed you can delete it by clicking the "X" that appears on hover. You can also reorder your images by dragging them into new positions.
